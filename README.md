## The core module is util/logger.js
## You just need to include it in your file in order to use it:
###### var logger = require('../util/logger');
###### logger.warn('warning message');
###### logger.error('error message');
###### logger.info('info message');

## all the logging message will be displayed at console, 
## as well as being logged into a file file at application root logs/all-logs.log
